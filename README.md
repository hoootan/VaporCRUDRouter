# CrudRouter

CrudRouter is a Rails-inspired extension to Vapor's routing system that makes it as simple as possible to set up CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) routes for any `Model`. CrudRouter provides an API very similar to Rails' `resources` but with a few extra features including automatic responder generation and type safety. 

## Installation
Within your Package.swift

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/twof/VaporCRUDRouter.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
and

```swift
targets: [
    .target(name: "App", dependencies: ["CrudRouter"]),
]
```

## Usage

Within your router setup (`routes.swift` in the default Vapor API template)
```swift
router.crud(register: Todo.self)
```
That's it!

That one line gets you the following routes.

```
GET     /todo       // returns all Todos
GET     /todo/:id   // returns the Todo with :id
POST    /todo       // create new Todo with provided body
PUT     /todo/:id   // update Todo with :id
DELETE  /todo/:id   // delete Todo with :id
```

Generated paths default to using lower snake case so for example, if you were to do

```swift
router.crud(register: SchoolTeacher.self)
```
you'd get routes like

```
GET     /school_teacher
GET     /school_teacher/:id
POST    /school_teacher
PUT     /school_teacher/:id
DELETE  /school_teacher/:id
```

#### Path Configuration
If you'd like to supply your own path rather than using the name of the supplied model, you can also do that

```swift
router.crud("account", register: User.self)
```
results in

```
GET     /account
GET     /account/:id
POST    /account
PUT     /account/:id
DELETE  /account/:id
```

#### Nested Relations
Say you had a model `User`, which was the parent of another model `Todo`. If you'd like routes to expose all `Todo`s that belong to a specific `User`, you can do something like this.

```swift
router.crud(register: User.self) { controller in
    controller.crud(children: \.todos)
}
```

results in

```
GET     /user
GET     /user/:id
POST    /user
PUT     /user/:id
DELETE  /user/:id

GET     /user/:id/todo      // returns all Todos belonging to the User with :id
GET     /user/:id/todo/:id  // returns the Todo with :id belonging to the User with :id
POST    /user/:id/todo      // creates a new Todo belonging to the User with :id
PUT     /user/:id/todo/:id  // updates the Todo with :id belonging to the User with :id
DELETE  /user/:id/todo/:id  // deletes the Todo with :id belonging to the User with :id
```

within the supplied closure, you can also expose routes for related `Parent`s and `Sibling`s

```swift
controller.crud(children: \.todos)
controller.crud(parent: \.todos)
controller.crud(siblings: \.todos)
```

#### Including or Excluding Specific Routes
If you'd like to register a `Model`, but you don't want every route to be available, you can specify the ones you want, or exclude the ones you don't.

```swift
router.crud(register: Todo.self, .except([.create, .delete])) { controller in
    controller.crud(parent: \.owner, .only([.read]))
}
```

results in

```
PUT /todo/:id
GET /todo/:id
GET /todo

GET /todo/:id/tag/:id
```

### Future features
- query parameter support
- PATCH support
- more fine grained response statuses
- automatically expose relations (blocked by lack of Swift reflection support)
- documentation for all public functions
- generate models and rest routes via console command
- Publicable support ([potentially blocked by a compiler bug](https://forums.swift.org/t/how-to-select-different-associated-type-based-on-type-constraints/17214))
- Fine grained per route public return models
